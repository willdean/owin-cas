        <description>This is OWIN security middleware, so you'd use it much like the other bits of security middleware which MS is providing as part of the Katana project.

This is extremely basic, largely untested and broadly unfinished. I only put it on Github because someone asked to see the source. Don't use it unless you're confident you can test and debug it yourself.

That said, I would appreciate any feedback.</description>
